# diabeatthis

This project was developed as part of the Mobile App Development master’s module during the winter semester 2022/2023. The overarching theme of the module was "Social Media", with the task of creating a social media app for a specific target audience, community, or area of interest. Data was to be stored and accessible via a backend NoSQL Database in Firebase.

We decided to create a social media app for people with diabetes. The goal of the app was to provide a platform for sharing recipes. The standout feature of the app is its nutritional value calculation, specifically designed to meet the needs of individuals with diabetes. This Feature was planned to allow users to access helpful information more easily for better managing their diet.

## Tutor Feedback

Hey Guys, we rated your concept with 100% and this is the feedback for it. 

You have to implement the minimum requirements and we highly recommend focusing on these. A good usable app is more important to us than an immense feature richness! You can get a 1.0 by just implementing the minimum requirements. Your grading will greatly be influenced by if the app is easy and intuitive to use and “feels good”. 
Nonetheless, if you have the time to implement some of the nice-to-have features (or some of your own ideas), then feel free to add those as well.
